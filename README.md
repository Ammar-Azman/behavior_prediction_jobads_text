# Overview
User behavior analysis, modelling and prediction by text classification and multimodal dataset from job ads dataset.

# Objective
- Objective 1: To predict the behavior of user based on the text description and location for multimodal model.
- Objective 2: To create a recommender system based on the text desciption and job classification.

# Dataset
- 2 sources of dataset
    - ads-50k-events.csv
    - ads-50k.json

## Analysis

- Deep learning modelling sucessfully exceed the accuracy of base model.
- Theoritically, by increasing the epochs of training, the model accuracy will improve.
- However, there is a limitation in terms of computation power due to model is trained by using Google Colab free GPU (Tesla T4). Kernel has down for some reasons.
- Possible further experimentation:
    - Case 1:
        - [ ] Training for 100 epochs
        - [ ] Using pre-trained embedding (USE) and Huggingface transformer model.
        - [ ] Using different columns for multi-modal model.
        - [ ] Using useful callbacks such as RecudeLROnPlateau and EarlyStopping.
    - Case 2:
        - [ ] Building similarity score algorithm based on embedding vector.
